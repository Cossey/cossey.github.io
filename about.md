Hi, I’m a software engineer with over a decade of experience. I started out with Visual Basic 5 Control Creation Edition and QuickBasic, moved through Visual Basic 6 and VB.NET, and today C# is my preferred language. I also work with Java, JavaScript, and HTML5/CSS across different types of projects.

I previously worked as the in-house IT technician and data analyst for a large home improvement and hardware retailer. I was responsible for multiple printers, more than 50 PCs, EFTPOS terminals, and the data that kept everything running smoothly. That experience reinforced my focus on reliability, clear information, and practical solutions that people can depend on.

I’m a strong supporter of containerization, because it makes services easier to configure, move, and deploy, whether for small personal projects or more complex setups.

These days, my day job is in customer care at a major telecommunications company. It is a very script-driven environment, and my background lets me bring structured problem solving and attention to detail into situations that are often anything but.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about home automation and open source. I contribute to projects like openHAB and have implemented full home automation systems in real homes, with an emphasis on stability and ease of use.

I also use AI tools regularly. They help me express myself more clearly, enhance my productivity, and shape most of what you read here. In person I tend to speak more casually; AI helps me bridge the gap between how I think, how I talk, and how I share ideas online.

This space is where I share my projects, experiments, and thoughts from along the way. Thanks for stopping by.
