title: Home Automation
---
I use openHAB as the core of my home automation setup. It gives me the flexibility and control I’m after, without locking me into a single ecosystem.

One of the reasons I prefer openHAB over alternatives like Home Assistant is how it handles automation logic. I like being able to write automations in JavaScript, and that approach fits the way I think and work. Even though I’m not a big fan of Java, I still prefer this stack over Python-based solutions.

From here, I’ll be sharing some of my setups, ideas, and experiments with openHAB and home automation in general.
