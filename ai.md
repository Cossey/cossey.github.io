title: Artificial Intellegence
---
AI is a rapidly emerging technology that’s increasingly becoming a part of our everyday lives. It’s the next big thing in tech and will soon transform the way we work and live—willingly or not. That’s why I think it’s crucial to teach our children and young people about AI early on; those entering the workforce without AI skills will find themselves at a disadvantage compared to those who have embraced it.

I’ve seen firsthand how AI is being integrated into workplaces, sometimes prematurely or in ways that don’t always add value. For example, many call centres now use AI to generate notes after customer interactions. Initially, there was skepticism: AI-generated summaries can be hit or miss and don’t always capture the helpful detail that experienced agents include. But over time, the systems have improved. Now, summaries that used to take an agent 30–60 seconds to write can be automatically generated in about five seconds, saving valuable time.

Beyond note-taking, AI is also used to help agents craft email responses, ensuring replies are concise, consistent with a brand voice, and empathetic. Some see this as lazy or ingenuine, but as long as a human is still making decisions, following the right process, and reviewing the output, I see AI as a responsible and efficient assistant. Personally, I’ve found it educational: it’s helped me rethink how I write and communicate more clearly, with less fluff.

As a software engineer working in customer care, I’m in a fairly unique position. I design and refine my own AI helpers for different aspects of my role, then test them in real scenarios. If they don’t perform as expected, I adjust and iterate. I don’t have to wait for another team to build tools for me; I can experiment, validate, and improve quickly.

There are, of course, important limitations. Enterprise data protection is essential to prevent sensitive information or internal processes from leaking into AI systems. Even with those protections in place, I avoid sharing confidential or personal data. The productivity gains are not worth the risk of a potential privacy breach.

Everything on this site is drafted or refined with the help of AI. It helps me collect my thoughts, structure ideas, and express them more concisely than I usually would in day-to-day conversation.
